				<p class="section-subheader">Relevant content, all in one place.</p>
				<p>The new, redesigned WebMD mobile app provides users with a personalized experience by curating and presenting relevant medical tips, news and content based on their personal information, family history of medical issues, and habits.</p>

				<p class="section-header">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
				<p>To note the key features and different strengths of similar products, we decided to analyze three main competitors of WebMD: Mayo Clinic, Healthline, and Everday Health.</p>
				<img src="images/webmd/competitive.png" class="cs-img">
			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p class="section-header">SURVEY</p>
				<p>From our existing knowledge and experience with WebMD, our assumption was simple--users only come to WebMD when they are sick, and do not proactively browse its content to get medical information when they are not.
				To confirm our assumption and to understand the motivation and behavior of our users, we conducted two rounds of surveys. From the first survey of  <span class="bold">	192 participants</span>, we learned that:
					<ul>
						<li>Most people have used WebMD before, but only on occasions when they were sick and wanted to diagnose their symptoms</li>
						<li>Social media feed was the most common medium users chose in receiving medical news and updates</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>From this result, we confirmed that <span class="bold">user acquisition was not the issue at hand,</span> but we had to create a feature that would bring these users back to WebMD on a regular basis.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p class="cs-highlight">"Social media feed was the most common method for the users in keeping updated with a certain medical condition."</p>
				<p>From these insights, we decided to focus on a new feature of a personalized news feed based on users' information. This would provide a more refined content compared to receiving information from a social media feed.</p>
				We wanted to ensure that the users would be open to share their personal information and brief medical history with a secured and private app. So we conducted a second round of survey which confirmed that <span class="bold">79% of users who currently suffer from a medical condition or have a history of medical condition</span> would be willing to provide their information in order to receive a more personalized medical information.

				<p>We conducted <span class="bold">six user interviews</span> with potential WebMD users (have used WebMD before, primarily use the internet to receive medical information, or consider themselves health-conscious) to understand the user needs better.</p>
				<p class="section-header-grey">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users with family history of certain medical conditions wanted a tool to easily keep themselves informed on the topic</li>

				<p>In this project, I definitely learned the importance of data and well-crafted research in a design process. Here is what <span class="bold">went well:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>We spent the first week and a half on research, which set a solid ground for our designs</li>
					<li>Being aware of the patterns that showed in our survey responses greatly helped in making our design decisions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although we got very useful user insights from the free-response questions of the survey, we made the mistake of <span class="bold">creating multiple-choice questions that were too generic</span> which we did not get a lot of useful data from. Since then, I spent some time on learning more about survey design methods, and hope to have better results for my next project.</p>
