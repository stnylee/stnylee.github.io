				<p>WebMD is having a hard time increasing the user acquisition and retention rate. It also wants to provide a more personalized experience for the users when browsing through its massive library of medical content.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p class="section-header">SOLUTION</p>
				<p class="section-subheader">Relevant content, all in one place.</p>
				<p>The new, redesigned WebMD mobile app provides users with a personalized experience by curating and presenting relevant medical tips, news and content based on their personal information, family history of medical issues, and habits.</p>

				<p class="section-header">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</p>
				<p>To note the key features and different strengths of similar products, we decided to analyze three main competitors of WebMD: Mayo Clinic, Healthline, and Everday Health.</p>
				<img src="images/webmd/competitive.svg" class="cs-img">
			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p class="section-header">SURVEY</p>
				<p>From our existing knowledge and experience with WebMD, our assumption was simple--users only come to WebMD when they are sick, and do not proactively browse its content to get medical information when they are not.
				To confirm our assumption and to understand the motivation and behavior of our users, we conducted two rounds of surveys. From the first survey of  <span class="bold">	192 participants</span>, we learned that:
					<ul>
						<li>Most people have used WebMD before, but only on occasions when they were sick and wanted to diagnose their symptoms</li>
						<li>Social media feed was the most common medium users chose in receiving medical news and updates</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>From this result, we confirmed that <span class="bold">user acquisition was not the issue at hand,</span> but we had to create a feature that would bring these users back to WebMD on a regular basis.</p>

				<img src="images/webmd/pie.svg" class="cs-img m-b-40">
				<div class="survey-note">
					<p>Only 3% of the participants considered themselves a frequent user of WebMD.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p class="cs-highlight">"Social media feed was the most common method for the users in keeping updated with a certain medical condition."</p>
				<p>From these insights, we decided to focus on a new feature of a personalized news feed based on users' information. This would provide a more refined content compared to receiving information from a social media feed.</p>
				We wanted to ensure that the users would be open to share their personal information and brief medical history with a secured and private app. So we conducted a second round of survey which confirmed that <span class="bold">79% of users who currently suffer from a medical condition or have a history of medical condition</span> would be willing to provide their information in order to receive a more personalized medical information.

				<p class="section-header">USER INTERVIEWS</p>
				<p>We conducted <span class="bold">six user interviews</span> with potential WebMD users (have used WebMD before, primarily use the internet to receive medical information, or consider themselves health-conscious) to understand the user needs better.</p>
				<p class="section-header-grey">KEY TAKEAWAYS:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users with family history of certain medical conditions wanted a tool to easily keep themselves informed on the topic</li>
						<li>Users are often frustrated with the process of browsing through Google search results to find relevant medical information</li>

				<p class="section-header">IDEATION</p>

				<div class="cs-100 m-b-40">
					<p class="section-header-grey">PERSONALIZED NEWS FEED</p>

					<p class="section-header-grey">CUSTOMIZABLE TOPICS</p>

				<p class="section-header">PERSONAS</p>

				<p>In this flow, Mark is logging in for the first time. He signs up for an account and enters his personal information. Then he browses through the news feed, finds an article and shares it with his contacts.</p>

				<p class="m-b-5">2. She then browses through My WebMD to see her saved article</p>

				<p class="section-header">SKETCHES</p>
				<p>In the early sketches, we came up with a few different UI styles, and ultimately decided on a bottom menu bar. Since many people were going to their social media for their medical content, we decided to create a sense of familiarity for the users by benchmarking Facebook and Twitter's navigation style.</p>

				<p class="section-header">USABILITY TESTING</p>
				<p>After we created wireframes, we created a clickable prototype on InVision, and conducted usability testing on potential WebMD users.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Users found the navigation and overall UI layout intuitive and familiar</li>
					<li>When instructed to find the Symptom Checker tool, many users went to the search menu instead of the Tools menu</li>
					<li>Users responded negatively to the message feature, and would not use it</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="cs cs-100">
				<p>Iterating based on the results of the usability testing, we made a couple last-minute pivots:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Include the Symptom Checker tool in both Tools and Search menu

				<P class="section-subheader">Ask the right questions.</P>
				<p>In this project, I definitely learned the importance of data and well-crafted research in a design process. Here is what <span class="bold">went well:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li>We spent the first week and a half on research, which set a solid ground for our designs</li>
					<li>Being aware of the patterns that showed in our survey responses greatly helped in making our design decisions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although we got very useful user insights from the free-response questions of the survey, we made the mistake of <span class="bold">creating multiple-choice questions that were too generic</span> which we did not get a lot of useful data from. Since then, I spent some time on learning more about survey design methods, and hope to have better results for my next project.
