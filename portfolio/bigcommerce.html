			<h3>Project Scope</h3>
			<p class="margin">This was a client project I worked on with a group of two other UX designers completed over the course of 3 weeks. We worked with the design team at Bigcommerce to create an onboarding flow for the new users. Our team collectively worked on the <span class="bold">research and ideation</span>, and I was responsible for <span class="bold">wireframing, prototyping and visual design</span> of the project.</p>	
		</div>
		<div class="wrapper text-align-left margin-top-120">
				<h3>Challenge</h3>
				<h2>Onboard and educate the users.</h2>
				<p class="margin-top-20">Our task was to <span class="bold">create an onboarding process which guides the new users through the basic store set-up process</span>. The new onboarding flow will acquaint them with the many features of Bigcommerce and ultimately increase the  conversion rate.</p>	
				<p class="margin-top-20">The existing version of the product sends the users directly into the product's complex UI, and presents a checklist of tasks to complete. This proved to be unintuitive and confusing for many of the users.</p>
				<p class="margin-top-20">The team at Bigcommerce also tasked us to develop a solution to reducing the large amount of calls the customer support team receives.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="wrapper text-align-left margin-top-120">	
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<h2>Easy, 5-step set-up guide.</h2>
			<p class="margin-top-20">To streamline the store set-up process while eliminating the distractions, we decided to create a flow outside of the product's UI.</p>	
			<p class="margin-top-20">Our design will:</p>	
			<ul class="ul-process">
				<li>Funnel users through the store creation process</li>
				<li>Provide a way for the users to gradually become familiar with Bigcommerce's product</li>
				<li>Educate users of Bigcommerce's advanced tools and functions</li>

					<li>About 50% of users are able to resolve their issues while browsing through the Support Portal (Bigcommerce's help center articles)</li>

			<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p class="margin-top-40">For the competitive analysis, we decided to focus on examining only the onboarding process of the competitors' products.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-20">Insights:</p>
			<ul class="ul-process">
					<li>Bigcommerce had the longest loading time in creating the store</li>
					<li>Checklist was a common format for the onboarding process, but didn't seem very effective for any of them</li>
					<li>Bigcommerce had a more difficult set-up process compared to its competitors</li>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p class="margin-bottom-40">After sketching and iterations, we came up with two versions of the designs. One was within Bigcommerce's UI, while the other one was completely separate.</p>
			<p class="bold margin-bottom-10">Version 1</p>
			<p class="margin-bottom-10">This version would familiarize the users with Bigcommerce's UI, but would potentially cause more distraction.</p>

			<p class="bold margin-bottom-10">Version 2</p>

				<p>We decided to run our usability tests with Version 1 with a few ecommerce business owners. We learned that:</p>

					<li>Users strongly preferred the 5-step process over the existing checklist</li>

			<h2 class="text-align-left margin-bottom-20">1. Select a design</h2>
			<p class="text-align-left margin-bottom-40">From our user interviews, we learned that one of the most satisfying parts of the online store creation experience was choosing a design for the website.

			<h2 class="text-align-left">2. Add a product</h2>
			<p class="text-align-left margin-bottom-40">In our design, we limited the number of required fields to a minimum. This was done in order to not overwhelm the users in the process, but also allowing them to have a feeling of accomplishment going through the process.</p>

			<h3>What I've Learned</h3>
			<h2>Being resourceful pays off.</h2>
			<p>For this project, we had no access to a list of current customers to contact for an interview. We worked around this by conducting extensive interviews with customer support, who are in the forefront of handling customer experience. This provided us with valuable information which we were able to base our design decisions on.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-20">We also scavenged for potential subjects within our contacts, and found a few ecommerce business owners to gain insights from as well.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-20">Sometimes, certain external limitations and situations can affect the process of your projects, but I learned that it is important to work with what you have, and produce the best results you can from it.</p>
