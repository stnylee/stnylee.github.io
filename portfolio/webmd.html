				<h3 class="padding-top-60">Project Scope</h3>
				<p>This project was completed for General Assembly's UXDi program over the course of 2 weeks. I developed this project as part of a 3 member team of UX design students to solve a problem for WebMD, a medical information & news website.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="righthalf">
				<h3 class="padding-top-60">My Role</h3>
				<p>Our team collaboratively worked on ideation of the solution, research, synthesis and iteration. I took responsibility of wireframing and prototyping. As an extension to the project, I also worked on the visual design and created a high-fidelity mockup of the app.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="wrapper middle margin-top-120">
			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<h2>A more personalized experience.</h2>
			<p> WebMD wants to increase its user acquisition and retention. The company has come to an understanding that users have difficulty parsing through its massive collection of content. Our challenge was to create an experience that is more personalized and meaningful to the users.</p>	
		</div>
		<div class="wrapper middle margin-top-120">	
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<h2>Relevant content, all in one place.</h2>
			<p>The new, redesigned WebMD mobile app provides users with a personalized experience by curating and presenting relevant medical tips and news as well as WebMD-exclusive content based on their personal information, family history of medical issues, and daily habits.</p>
		</div>

	<section class="greybg padding-60">

				<h3>Process</h3>
				<h2>Research, confirm, design.</h2>
				<p>From our existing knowledge and experience with WebMD, our assumption was simple--users only come to WebMD when they are sick, and do not proactively browse its content to get medical information when they are not.</p>
				<p class="m20">To confirm our assumption and to understand the motivation and behavior of our users, we conducted two rounds of surveys. From the <span class="bold">first survey of 192 participants</span>, we learned that:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>71% of the participants have used WebMD before</li>
					<li>But they mostly only used WebMD to diagnose symptoms when they were sick</li>
					<li>Social media feed was the most common medium users chose in receiving medical news and updates</li>
				</ul>
				<p>From this result, we confirmed that <span class="bold">user acquisition was not the issue at hand,</span> but we had to create a feature that would bring these users back to WebMD on a regular basis.</p>

			<div class="padding-20">"Social media feed was the most common method for the users in keeping updated with a certain medical condition."</div>
			<hr>
		</div>
		<div class="wrapper text-align-left">
			<p>From these insights, we decided to implement the new feature of a personalized news feed based on users' information. This would create a more meaningful experience for users interested in receiving relevant medical news and information. It would also have a more refined content compared to receiving information from a social media feed.</p>
			<p class="m20">To implement this feature, we wanted to ensure that the users would be open to share their personal information and brief medical history with a secured and private app. So we conducted a <span class="bold">second round of survey</span>, which confirmed that 79% of users who currently suffer from a medical condition or have a history of medical condition would be willing to provide their information in order to receive a more personalized medical information.</p>
			<h2 class="m40">Restructuring the existing features</h2>
			<p>In addition to the new personalized feed feature, we decided on a complete restructuring of the app while keeping a lot of its existing tools which we found to be valuable. Ambiguous section titles were changed, and scattered glossary pages were combined into one search page.</p>

		<div class="wrapper text-align-left">
			<h2>Onboarding Flow</h2>
			<p>In the onboarding flow, we wanted to ensure that users knew why asking the personal information, and how it was going to benefit them. to eliminate as much hesitancy from the users as possible, we also emphasized the security and privacy of the app as well.</p>

			<h2>Topics</h2>
			<p>Once the users fill out their information, a list of topics will be generated which will be used to provide relevant content. Ihe users can edit the list of topics before proceeding, and add new topics as well. I decided to add a little fun factor to the onboarding process by implementing interactivity to the topic circles.</p>

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			<p>The tools on the existing app were given more intuitive names and icons, and were put into the tools section. After a number of feedback and iterations, I decided to put an emphasis on symptom checker, which is the most frequently used function on WebMD based on our research.</p>

			<h3>What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>Through working on this project, I have definitely learned the importance of useful data and well-crafted research in a meaningful design process. The insights we gained from our surveys became the foundation for our ideas and decisions, and acted as a guidance for our process.</p>
			<p class="m20">Our team as a whole learned to work together efficiently, and maintained an atmosphere of openness and collaboration throughout. We learned to grow on each other's ideas and encourage each other in a productive way. I am very proud of what our team was able to accomplish within a period of two weeks, and we were able to grow so much in a short amount of time. This project was definitely a blast to work on, and I think we are in a much better position to learn more and improve from here on.
